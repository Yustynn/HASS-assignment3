    <h1>Visualization of Percentage Price Increase for High Floor vs Low Floor in Various Towns</h1>
    <p>Red: Negative difference (low floor more valuable than high floor) | Blue: Positive difference (high floor more valuable than low floor)</p>

    <p>This data was obtained by aggregating resale prices of flats from 2000-2012</p>
    <p>In particular, the approximate procedure was:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Filter to blocks with at least 5 low floor resales (below 7th storey)</li>
      <li>Filter to blocks with at least 5 high floor resales (above 13th storey)</li>
      <li>Find the ratio of (high floor resale mean) / (low floor resale mean) for flats in the same block sold on the same year</li>
      <li>Take the mean of these ratios for each town</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For studying the effect of the flat type, a breakdown is provided by flat type as well.</p>
    <p>To be honest, there are a lot of things difficult to control for, so do take this with a pinch of salt. E.g. didn't control for month-of-year effects, didn't weigh the mean by number of data points per block, etc etc.</p>
